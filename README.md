# CO2 Emissions Calculator for fligths

The idea os this website is to display the carbon emissions of flying between two cities, using different types of aircraft.

This implementation is a minimum viable product, which is a version of the product with just enough features to be usable.
However in a later implementation, CSS features and google charts will be added to make the website more appealing.

## Features 

It has stored some example origin and destination airports and its coordinates
There are embedded functions to calculate the distance between two points on the earth (great-circle distance)
There are regression results to estimate fuel burn between cities depending on each aircraft
From the fuel burn (in Kg) there is an estimation of CO2 emissions
It then displays the results divided on a per seat (passenger) basis


### Features Left to Implement

In a test version, google charts worked to display the data, which didnt't work during git implementation.
Faced with this, I rolled back to the bare bones version.

## Testing 


### Validator Testing 

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript


### Unfixed Bugs

As stated above, my ideal implementation didn't work during git implementation.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
